## js-symbol-tree Forked version 

This repo was created to make [js-symbol-tree](https://github.com/jsdom/js-symbol-tree) library to work with [React](https://reactjs.org/) builds.

Basically this repo will generate the files you need to be able to run a build with React.

## Usage

First clone the repo:

```
git clone
```

then, run 

```
npm install
```

once you've installed everything just do

```
npm run build
```

this command will generate a folder called `distribution`, just copy those files into the `**/node_modules.**/symbol-tree/lib/`
